# Landing-Club

The Lending Club project involves calculating a loan score based on three major factors: Loan Payment History, Customer’s Financial Health, and Loan Defaulters History. The project includes data cleaning, transformation, and storage processes using Apache PySpark, and the final cleaned data is used to create permanent tables for downstream analytics.

# Key Steps and Components
## 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
   1. Loan Payment History: Data includes historical payments, interest received, and late fees.
   2. Customer’s Financial Health: Data includes customer employment details, income, home ownership, etc. 
   3. Loan Defaulters History: Data includes delinquencies, public records, bankruptcies, and enquiries.

## 2. Created Processed Dataframes

## 3. Created permanent tables for multiple teams to access the cleaned data.

## 4. Created a view on the cleaned data that refreshes every 24 hours for up-to-date analysis.
